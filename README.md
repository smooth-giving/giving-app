##[Introduction](id:introduction)
Smooth Giving is an idea born from the frustration that, donors and charitable organizations alike, felt toward current web-based solutions for giving and accepting donations. 

By removing many of the barriers inherent within the donation process that may deter possible patrons from contributing, Smooth Giving is built to work right from an organizations website to help maintain visually, that donor is contributing to that specific organization.


##[Requirements](id:requirements)

Smooth Giving utilizes the following technologies to streamline the way people donate to their favorite non-profits or charitable organizations:  


###Stripe
	
Smooth Giving leverages the power of Stripe as our merchant processor.  Stripe offers a secure, unobtrusive point of payment for donors.

>Stripe.js securely transmits card details from browsers to Stripe. Use it to control every pixel of the experience and let Stripe take care of the pesky processing and compliance.   

###Node
Information about the Node side of things.... 

###Grunt
Smooth Giving uses Grunt as it's automated task runner. 

###Node-sass
For the front-end side of things, Smooth Giving utilizes Node-sass to process our Sass.  [Node-sass](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-sass) is a Node.js wrapper around libsass.  To install, simply ```npm install node-sass```.	

###Node-bourbon
[![image](http://www.anthonygthomas.com/reveal.js/presentations/sass/web-standards/images/bourbon-logo.png)](https://github.com/lacroixdesign/node-bourbon)  

Bourbon is a sass mixin library, written for development in the Rails environment.  The folks over at [LaCroix Design](http://lacroixdesign.net/) have created this fantastic node-sass port of the Bourbon library (yay!).

To install as a development dependency, run:

```npm install --save-dev node-bourbon```  

If you need it in production, replace ```--save-dev``` with ```--save```.

###Node-neat

Neat is a semantic, fluid grid framework on top of Sass and Bourbon.  Again, the good folks at [LaCroix Design](http://lacroixdesign.net/) have created a node-sass port of the Neat library for your Node-ing pleasure.

To install as a development dependency, run:

```npm install --save-dev node-neat```  

If you need it in production, replace ```--save-dev``` with ```--save```.
